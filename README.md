## Project Overview

AggieFlow provides student project teams with a centralized dashboard for organizing tasks, monitoring progress, and collaborating efficiently. Users can create teams, manage task assignments, and view interactive charts that summarize workload distribution and upcoming deadlines. The system supports real-time updates so changes made by one team member are immediately reflected for others. The primary focus of this project is frontend development and user experience, while still incorporating backend APIs, real-time network communication, and data manipulation.
